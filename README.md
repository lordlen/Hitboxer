# Hitboxer
## Purpose
While creating a prototype for my fighting game, I realized that creating hitboxes by manually entering numeric values per animation frame is very difficult. I then had an idea to
create an application to smooth out this process.

## Features
 - Allow easy loading for grid-based texture atlases
 - loading and saving hitbox data in a separate file
 - create hitboxes by dragging mouse
 - up to 5 colors for hitboxes
